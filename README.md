# Unity-in-Action-3d-Tutorial
I am learning Unity game engine through the book by Joseph Hocking, Unity in Action.
this project is teaching us about how to move in a 3D world space, it also teaches us how to work with particles systems, and a basic AI.
the Code was written by me but taken from the book to learn concepts to develop my own games in Unity, the art assets are also kindly provided by the author
